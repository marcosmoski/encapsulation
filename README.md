# :hammer: ENCAPSULATION :question:

- `Explanation:`:

- Encapsulation is a concept of POO that means you are private attributes of your class and encapsulate it inside functions, that will be getters and setters where getters will return the attribute value and setters will change it.
- Basically using it, we have a better way to controll the data in a consistent manner.
